## Webinar Description

**Date/Time**: January 12, 11am

**Title**: Hands-On Tableau Desktop: Mapping the 2016 Presidential Election

**Description**: Participants of this introductory webinar will gain hands-on experience generating interactive maps and map-centric dashboards using Tableau Desktop. The content we will focus on during this webinar will be 2016 Presidential election results by voter tabulation district in Texas and Census data from the American Community Survey. (Unfortunately, it is too early to obtain 2020 results by VTD. Stayed tuned for future mapping workshops when 2020 data is released.)

**Participation**: Participants can follow along or sit back and watch. To follow along, please install Tableau Desktop prior to the webinar starting. * Either Tableau Desktop Public (freely available) or Tableau Desktop Professional (fee-based, free to students and teachers) will work perfectly for this webinar.
